    <p><strong>Musk</strong> was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the <strong>University of Pretoria</strong> before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He moved to <strong>California in 1995</strong> to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics and <strong>material sciences at Stanford University</strong>, but decided to pursue a 
      <strong>business career</strong> instead of enrolling. He co-founded (with his brother Kimbal) Zip2,<strong> a web software company
      </strong>, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded<strong> X.com</strong>, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for <strong> $1.5 billion</strong> in October 2002</p>

       "There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing."
